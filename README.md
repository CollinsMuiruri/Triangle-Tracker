# The Triangle Tracker.

![How the page looks like](https://github.com/CollinsMuiruri/Triangle-Tracker/blob/master/shot.png)

This is a simple Javascript code that lets a user input lengths of a Triangle.
The program then checks if the values are viable to make a Triangle.
It then calculates and outputs whether the Triangle is Isosceles, Equlateral or Scalene.
